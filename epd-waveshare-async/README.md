# epd-waveshare-async

Async drivers for Waveshare's e-paper displays.

This is inspired by both the existing (sync) [epd-waveshare](https://github.com/caemor/epd-waveshare) crate, and the [e-Paper](https://github.com/waveshareteam/e-Paper/tree/master) code published by Waveshare directly.

For now, this library only supports the display(s) I am actively testing with it. Once in a stable state, contributions for more displays will be welcome.
